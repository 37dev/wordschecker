* It assumes that you have python 3 installed
* It requires basic knowledge on how to run a command line script

How to run:
Download the script in https://github.com/37dev/wordschecker/archive/master.zip
Extract it into a folder
Inside that folder, click with right button and click "open termianl here" (it may vary depending on the system)

Run the script itself by typing `python3 bot.py` then type a sentence

Run tests by typing `python3 -m unittest bot_tests.py` and it should print an "OK" in the screen
